                    Needless to say, doctors, nurses and people working in health-care sectors are particularly vulnerable to the
                    highly infectious disease. In response to the global pandemic, the under-resourced doctors are facing
                    unprecedented challenges. The list of the sleep-deprived heroes includes doctors, nurses, medical cleaners, 
                    pathologists, paramedics, ambulance drivers, and health-care administrators. In the fight against coronavirus, 
                    the brave medical army stands strong with thermometers, stethoscopes, and ventilators as their weapons. Not to forget, 
                    medical researchers are working day in and night out against all odds, hoping to find the antidote to the disease.
                    <br><br>
                    Since the coronavirus outbreak, health-care professionals have not only experienced the gratification of healing patients 
                    and saving their lives but have also lost many battles along the way. On top of that, many doctors have even sacrificed 
                    their own lives in the line of duty.
                    <br>
                    Every day, the selfless warriors are giving it their all in health-care settings while cutting themselves off from their 
                    families and loved ones. The sacrifice that they are making for the safety and welfare of humanity is priceless and
                    deserves lifelong gratitude on our end. Most importantly, we must reassess the value health-care workers hold in our 
                    lives and the kind of treatment they get from us. Among the several lessons this coronavirus pandemic has been teaching us,
                    the biggest one is to find ways to sufficiently invest in the better and more efficient medical fraternity and give medical
                    professionals the respect, compensation and infrastructure that they truly deserve once this crisis is over. Moreover,
                    the world needs to work towards advancement in medical research and technology. Nothing will be a greater tribute to the 
                    health-care workers than this.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That being said, we'd now like to highlight the heroic efforts of some courageous and inspiring doctors from across the 
                    globe who lost their lives while saving the lives of COVID-19 patients.
